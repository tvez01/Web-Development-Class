        <h2>Proprietary AI Risk Consulting Framework</h2>
        <p>During my summer internship at PANW, my team and I created an 
          AIRA workbook with diverse deliverables that enable practical remediation
          for identified risks and vulnerabilities for their Unit 42.

        <h2>King's Conquer</h2>
        <p>King's Conquer was created by my teammate and I for the TechWise program. The game consists 
          of three mini games all coded in python. The first game is Royal Merge and blends chess with 
          the game 2048. The second game is an AI powered chess game. The last game is Mortal Knight Showdown. 
          This game is a mixture of chess, tetris, and 2048.
